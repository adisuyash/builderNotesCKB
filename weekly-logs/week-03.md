## Week 02

**Date:** 8th - 14th Oct, 2025

### Tasks Completed

- Explored the basics of Rust syntax and how a Rust program is structured.
- Understood the purpose of the `main()` function as the entry point of every Rust program.
- Learned about compiler attributes, such as `#![allow(unused)]` — which suppress warnings for unused code and is useful while prototyping or experimenting.
- Studied how macros work in Rust — identified by an exclamation mark (`!`) and how they differ from standard functions.
- Executed the classic “Hello Rust” program using the `println!` macro and understood how it expands code at compile time.
- Explored placeholder constructs like `todo!()` — useful to mark incomplete functions while allowing the rest of the code to compile successfully.
- Understood that invoking `todo!()` triggers a runtime panic, reminding developers that the implementation is pending.
- Reviewed the **typical Rust project structure**:

  - `src/lib.rs` → main logic for libraries
  - `src/main.rs` → entry point for executables
  - `Cargo.toml` → configuration and dependencies

- Started the _[Rust Programming Basics](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/rust-programming-basics)_ course & added a `rust/` directory regarding the same.
- Also finished a couple of videos from the same course
- Read and explored the basics from the official _[Rust Docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)_.

### Covered These Tech-Terms via Courses & Docs:

- Attributes (`#![...]`)
- Macros (`println!`, `todo!`)
- Ownership placeholder behavior
- Runtime panic
- Project structure (`src/lib.rs`, `Cargo.toml`)
- Entry point (`main()` function)
